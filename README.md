# Open Sourced Projects
These projects are free for you to use and are mostly just old, unfinished, unreleased, and cancelled projects of mine, going as far back as when I first started Roblox Development.

# Which projects should I use?
There are three folders, each representing a level of quality: legacy, classic, and modern.

### Legacy
These are my oldest projects, and are mostly here for archival purposes. I don't recommend you learn from these or use them.
Download the legacy projects here: https://github.com/MiaGobble/Open-Sourced-Projects/releases/tag/legacy

### Classic
These are what I consider to be my "classic" games, following my old style for development. Not super great in terms of production quality, but they are more usable.
Download the classic projects here: https://github.com/MiaGobble/Open-Sourced-Projects/releases/tag/classic

### Modern
The modern projects are much more recent and are best to learn from. I recommend you use these instead of the other two.
